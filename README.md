# Hi, I'm Angel! 👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

I'm a software engineer from Spain. Currently finishing my PhD in Neuroscience at [Grupo de Neurocomputación Biológica](https://github.com/GNB-UAM), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 

My interests are:
- Computational modelling of dynamical systems (mainly in neuroscience)
- Real-time hardware and software
- Temporal coding in the nervous system (and information theory approaches)

🔭 My research is currently focused on [modelling the electromotor command network of pulse mormyrids](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/electromotor-nmodel) using genetic algorithms and other ML-based approaches to fit model parameters. I am also working in developing [real-time stimulation protocols](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00041/full) based on codes and information theory measures for stablishing closed-loop stimulation cycles with real fish (*Gnathonemus petersii*).

💬 Contact me if you have any comment, suggestion or doubt about my work.

## Other interests

### Ecology and sustainability

I have designed an [Arduino-based open-source datalogger](https://github.com/united-ecology/btmboard) for measuring conductance of up to 8 measures (succesfully applied to estimate water content in moss and lichens).

If you are interested, you can check the related video and publication: [BtM, a Low-cost Open-source Datalogger to Estimate the Water Content of Nonvascular Cryptogams](https://www.jove.com/video/58700/btm-low-cost-open-source-datalogger-to-estimate-water-content).
