# Hi, I'm Angel! 👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

I'm a software engineer from Spain. Currently finishing my PhD in Neuroscience at [Grupo de Neurocomputación Biológica](https://github.com/GNB-UAM), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.

I also develop small video games as a hobby. Check [my profile at itch.io](https://alfxogo.itch.io/) or [my blog](http://terraludus.blogspot.com/) (in spanish).
