# Hi, I'm Angel! 👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

I'm a software engineer from Spain. Currently finishing my PhD in Neuroscience at [Grupo de Neurocomputación Biológica](https://github.com/GNB-UAM), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. 

🔭 My research is currently focused on modelling the electromotor command network of pulse mormyrids using genetic algorithms and other ML-based approaches to fit model parameters. I am also working developing real-time stimulation protocols based on information theory measures for stablishing closed-loop stimulation cycles with real fish (*Gnathonemus petersii*).

I am interested in:
- Modelling dynamical systems (mainly in neuroscience)
- Real time programming
- Temporal coding in the nervous system (and information theory approaches)
- Machine learning

I also develop small video games as a hobby. Check [my profile at itch.io](https://alfxogo.itch.io/) or [my blog](http://terraludus.blogspot.com/) (in spanish).
