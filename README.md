# Hi, I'm Angel! 👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

I'm from Spain. I have a PhD in Computer Engineering.

My current interests are:
- Computational modelling of dynamical systems. [Check this C++ library!] (https://github.com/angellareo/neun)
- FLOSS hardware and software applied in sustainability studies. You can check [this Arduino-based low-consumption datalogger](https://github.com/united-ecology/btmboard).

🔭 My previous research projects were focused on:
- [Modelling the electromotor command network of pulse mormyrids](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/electromotor-nmodel). 
- Developing [closed-loop stimulation protocols](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00041/full) based on information theory measures for studying temporal coding in the nervous system.

💬 Contact me if you have any comment, suggestion or doubt about my work.
